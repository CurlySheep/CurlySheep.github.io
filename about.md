Hi, I'm current in the statistics master program in NCSU. I will finish the program at the end of this year, and after that I decided to apply for a statistics P.h.D degree.

I enjoy palying badiminton and board games in free time. I like taking exercise, but since it's mid summer in my country now, sitting at home playing board games with my friends is really a pleasure.

### A Portrait

My girlfriend draw a portrait for me and I like it so much. I want to share it!
