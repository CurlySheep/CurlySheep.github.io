# Reflection

## What would I Do Differently

In this project I cooperate with Adeyemi Adepetun [whose github repo page is here.](https://github.com/yemoray?tab=repositories)

So he did all the github works (created repo page, automated generate report and so on) and I didn't help a lot. I only wrote code this project and next time I can do the github job to have a practice.

## Most Difficult Part

I only did some coding this project so nothing puzzled me for a long time. I did spent some time trying to figure out how to compare all the 4 models (at the begining I thought we had to use 2 regression model and 2 classification model so I had no idea how to compare them), and spent some time studying the process of boosted tree.

## Big Take-aways

I guess my biggest take-away is that I learned plenty of coding tips. My partner Adeyemi can write all the codes tidy and beautiful. Besides, auto generate part also sounds fresh for me.
