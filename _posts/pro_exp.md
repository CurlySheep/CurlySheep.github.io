# R vs SAS

I only learned SAS for 1 sememster and I'm not good at it, so my opinion may be a little unfair. To me, SAS is too difficult and too restricted. R code is more readable than SAS; I can freely identify anything in R like functions or vectors, which is more difficult to do in SAS. Reading data in SAS is just a disaster, 'disaster' even contaion 'SAS'!

However, the table and statistics analysis output by SAS is charming and detailed, where you can nearly find everything you want from a statistics model report.
