# About Data Scientists and Their Duties/Knowledge Areas

To me, data scientists sound more related to data analysis. Usually they have to face plenty of data collected by different organizations, trying to figure out useful information by fitting multiple models. They focus more on the function of the model rather than understand the model theoretically, because steps like washing data, designing and evaluating models will cost much of the time.

Data scientists are not only required to be proficient in Machine Learning, Time series, basic statistics subjects and so on, but also required to understand the knowledge about the data they are working on. For example, a data scientist working in a hospital must also have knowledge of public health, and a data scientist working in a Construction company should have knowledge of structural mechanics. Otherwise, they may face problem when dealing with the data, such as when scaling the data or ranking the importance.

# Differences/similarities between Data Scientists and Statisticians

Obviously they shared the same standard knowledge. However, comparing to practical work, statisticians prefer to theoretically clarify the inner principle of the model. The methods in Machine Learning indeed can present good-looking result, but without understanding the model completely, the result will never be convincing enough. Statisticians parse, create and provide models for data scientists.

# About myself

I'm neither a talent person nor a really hard-working student, while I think a statistician requires both characteristics. I like study widely but not deeply, and I'm willing to acquire knowledge from different regions. That's why I would more like to be a data scientist.
