# About Data Scientists and Their Duties/Knowledge Areas

To me, data scientists sound more related to data analysis. Usually they have to face plenty of data collected by different organizations, trying to figure out useful information by fitting multiple models. They focus more on the function of the model rather than understand the model theoretically, because steps like washing data, designing and evaluating models will cost much of the time.

Data scientists are not only required to be proficient in Machine Learning, Time series, basic statistics subjects and so on, but also required to understand the knowledge about the data they are working on. For example, a data scientist working in a hospital must also have knowledge of public health, and a data scientist working in a Construction company should have knowledge of structural mechanics. Otherwise, they may face problem when dealing with the data, such as when scaling the data or ranking the importance.
