# About Data Scientist

I haven't thought about it before that data scientists also need to build the interaction UI/APP by themselves, because to me it sounds like a job for programmers. 
I really enjoy the process to create my own APP by shiny, while on the other hand, I'm still extremely confused about the Docker (I know the purpose and the mean idea behind it, but 
the CMD and the container stuff drives me crazy).

# R for Data Science

I like R. I would like to keep using it and I guess the main reason is that I'm now familiar with it. If you ask me to use Python or SAS, 
I still need to learn the code from the begining (I only used and learned for one semester for both so I can hardly recall anything about them). Besides, R is good at visiable presenting I think,
which is pretty important for those who don't understand statistics (I mean tables and plots are important for them to read and understand the whole data). So by using R, I can present
report for both statistician and normal people.

# Different Thing

The main difference is that I can create my own APP by shiny now. I can share my anlysis with my friends and my family if I want, and they can be more understandable about what I'm
currently doing now.
